  <h1>Making Stars</h1>

<p><strong>Why I love this problem:</strong><br>
First, you can easily make this hands-on by asking students to stand in a circle, choosing a &quot;skip number&quot;, and then passing a ball around to every nth person. Students can see for themselves exactly who touches the ball and who gets left out.</p>
<p>Second, once you start drawing stars, you start getting beautiful patterns!</p>
<p>Third, students will discover patterns involving primes, composites as well as the notion of &quot;relative prime&quot;. Two integers are <strong>relatively prime</strong> (or coprime) if there is no integer greater than one that divides them both</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Start with the physical versions of this activity if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Grade Band</strong>: 4th - 6th</p>
<p><strong>Math Content</strong>:  Prime and composite numbers. Factors and multiples. Angles.</p>
<p><strong>Math Standards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.OA - Gain familiarity with factors and multiples</li>
<li>4.OA - Generate and analyze patterns.</li>
<li>5.OA - Analyze patterns and relationships.</li>
<li>6.NS - Compute fluently with multi-digit numbers and find common factors and multiples.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standards of Mathematical Practice</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</li>
<li>Reason abstractly and quantitatively.</li>
<li>Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</li>
<li>Model with mathematics.</li>
<li>Use appropriate tools strategically.</li>
<li>Attend to precision.</li>
<li>Look for and make use of structure.</li>
<li>Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strategies to try</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a small number of points and explore all the different skip numbers.</li>
<li>Then add one more dot and repeat</li>
<li>Pause to look for patterns.</li>
<li>What do you notice about the times when not every point is included in the picture and when every point is included?</li>
<li>What happens if you double the number of points?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions to explore</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When do you get “pointy stars”?</li>
<li>When do you some of the dots get skipped?</li>
<li>Which stars are the prettiest to you?</li>
<li>What are the angles are formed?</li>
<li>If you had 24 points, would every skip number create a star? What about 23 points?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementing online</strong>:</p>
<p>Here are two Desmos activity builders you can use. Students can use these to quickly draw and explore many examples of stars.</p>
